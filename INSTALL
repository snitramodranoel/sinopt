Installing IPOPT on Gentoo Linux with MATLAB support

This document will guide you through the configuration and installation of
IPOPT on computers running Gentoo Linux with MATLAB support.

1) Pre-requisites

This guide assumes that you have installed the software listed below:

- GCC 4.3.4
- MATLAB R2011a or newer

2) Installing ATLAS

In order to provide more efficient linear algebra computations to IPOPT, it is
highly recommended that you install optimized BLAS/LAPACK software. To install
ATLAS, issue the following command as root:

# emerge lapack-atlas

3) Installing IPOPT

./configure \
 --prefix=/opt/ipopt \
 --enable-static \
 --with-matlab-home=/opt/matlab \
 CC=gcc-4.3.4 \
 CXX=g++-4.3.4 \
 F77=gfortran-4.3.4 \
 ADD_CFLAGS="-fPIC –fexceptions" \
 ADD_CXXFLAGS="-fPIC" \
 ADD_FFLAGS="-fPIC –fexceptions"
